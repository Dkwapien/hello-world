The beginning of something new!
My Name is Dawid Kwapien and I am the new Immigration and Mobility Program Manager (Contract) here at GitHub. I am originally from Chicago and have been living in San Diego, CA for the past three years now. I studied international relations in university and cannot wait to assist the GitHub team with all ove their immigration needs.
